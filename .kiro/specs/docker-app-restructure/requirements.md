# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves restructuring and correcting a full-stack application with FastAPI backend and React frontend to properly support both development and production environments using Docker and nginx. The application currently has issues with Docker configurations, nginx routing, missing production Dockerfile for frontend, and inconsistent environment handling. The goal is to create a robust, scalable deployment system that works seamlessly in both dev and prod environments with run_docker.sh as the primary entry point.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly structured Docker setup for development, so that I can run the application locally with hot reloading and easy debugging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `./run_docker.sh dev up` THEN the system SHALL start all development services with hot reloading enabled
2. WHEN the development environment starts THEN the frontend SHALL be accessible on port 5173 with Vite dev server
3. WHEN the development environment starts THEN the backend SHALL be accessible on port 8000 with FastAPI reload enabled
4. WHEN code changes are made THEN the system SHALL automatically reload the respective services
5. WHEN development services start THEN nginx SHALL be optional and not interfere with direct service access

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a production-ready Docker setup with nginx reverse proxy, so that I can deploy the application securely to a VM.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `./run_docker.sh prod up` THEN the system SHALL start all production services with nginx as reverse proxy
2. WHEN production environment starts THEN nginx SHALL serve the frontend static files and proxy API requests to backend
3. WHEN production environment starts THEN the frontend SHALL be built as static files and served efficiently
4. WHEN production environment starts THEN SSL/TLS SHALL be properly configured with certificate support
5. WHEN API requests are made THEN nginx SHALL properly route them to the backend service with rate limiting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper nginx configuration for both environments, so that routing, security, and performance are optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN nginx is configured THEN it SHALL properly route frontend requests to the React app
2. WHEN nginx is configured THEN it SHALL properly route API requests to the FastAPI backend
3. WHEN nginx is configured THEN it SHALL implement proper security headers and rate limiting
4. WHEN nginx is configured for production THEN it SHALL support SSL/TLS termination
5. WHEN nginx is configured THEN it SHALL handle CORS properly for cross-origin requests

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want missing Docker configurations to be created, so that all services can be properly containerized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frontend production Dockerfile is missing THEN the system SHALL create a proper multi-stage build Dockerfile
2. WHEN backend Dockerfiles exist THEN they SHALL be reviewed and corrected for best practices
3. WHEN Dockerfiles are created THEN they SHALL follow security best practices with non-root users
4. WHEN Dockerfiles are created THEN they SHALL be optimized for build caching and image size
5. WHEN containers are built THEN they SHALL include all necessary dependencies and configurations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want corrected Docker Compose configurations, so that services can communicate properly and dependencies are managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Docker Compose files are reviewed THEN they SHALL have correct service dependencies and health checks
2. WHEN Docker Compose files are reviewed THEN they SHALL have proper network configuration for service communication
3. WHEN Docker Compose files are reviewed THEN they SHALL have correct volume mounts for data persistence
4. WHEN Docker Compose files are reviewed THEN they SHALL have proper environment variable handling
5. WHEN services start THEN they SHALL wait for dependencies to be healthy before starting

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an improved run_docker.sh script, so that I can easily manage the application lifecycle across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use run_docker.sh THEN it SHALL support clear commands for dev/prod environments
2. WHEN I use run_docker.sh THEN it SHALL properly handle environment file copying
3. WHEN I use run_docker.sh THEN it SHALL provide clear status messages and error handling
4. WHEN I use run_docker.sh THEN it SHALL support cleanup operations with the delete flag
5. WHEN I use run_docker.sh THEN it SHALL validate prerequisites and provide helpful error messages

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want corrected environment configurations, so that services can connect properly in both dev and prod environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment files are used THEN they SHALL have correct service hostnames for Docker networking
2. WHEN environment files are used THEN they SHALL have proper database connection strings
3. WHEN environment files are used THEN they SHALL have correct Redis URLs for container communication
4. WHEN environment files are used THEN they SHALL have appropriate CORS origins for each environment
5. WHEN environment files are used THEN they SHALL have secure secrets and proper SSL configurations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to be tested in both environments, so that I can verify everything works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is restructured THEN it SHALL be tested in development mode
2. WHEN the application is restructured THEN it SHALL be tested in production mode
3. WHEN testing is performed THEN all services SHALL start successfully and be accessible
4. WHEN testing is performed THEN API endpoints SHALL respond correctly through nginx proxy
5. WHEN testing is performed THEN frontend SHALL load and communicate with backend properly
